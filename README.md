# Challenge-3
My Task
This week's task directs me to design a browser-based tool that enables employees to produce a random password based on their specified criteria. This application should dynamically alter its HTML and CSS visuals through the JavaScript you code. Moreover, its user interface should be sleek, intuitive, and designed to fit screens of varying sizes seamlessly. To equip you with the necessary skills for this assignment, the week's coursework is tailored to guide you through.

User Story
AS A staff member handling confidential information,
I WANT the ability to produce a password at random based on specific standards,
SO THAT I can establish a robust password ensuring enhanced protection.

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN my requirement for a highly secure password,
WHEN I press the password generation button,
THEN I encounter a set of prompts asking for password specifications.
WHEN presented with password specifications prompts,
THEN I determine which specifications to incorporate into the password.
WHEN inquired about the password's length,
THEN I opt for a length between 8 to 128 characters.
WHEN queried about the kinds of characters to use,
THEN I decide on the inclusion of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
WHEN I respond to each specification query,
THEN my choices are checked for validity, ensuring at least one character type is chosen.
WHEN all specification queries are completed,
THEN a password conforming to my choices is produced.
WHEN the password has been created,
THEN it is either showcased in an alert or displayed on the webpage.
